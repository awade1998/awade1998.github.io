        What is Drake Medical Alliance?</h1>
      <p>It is a federation of 5 practices from across plymouth. We are collaborating to improve and expand upon the services we provide to our patients, and support one another to ensure primary care delivery remains sustainable.</p>

      <h1>Â Why have the 5 practices come together?</h1>
      <p>Primary Care is a rapidly changing environment - the resources to deliver services are not necessarily as readily available or as well funded as historically might have been the case. This means that all services provided to patients need to be reviewed to ensure they are appropriate. The aim of all practices is to support the patient with the management of their healthcare - and as a group we can work to   improve our services to all patients.
To enable this we have to ensure we have adequately trained staff, and that they are supported by management and partners to deliver the most appropriate care and in the right place.
By collaborating we can better achieve these objectives, and put in place measures to ensure best practice continues and develops further in the future.</p>
